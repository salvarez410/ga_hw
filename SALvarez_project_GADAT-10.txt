Project Question

What is the question you hope to answer?

Are US health care plans consistent across the USA?

Corollary questions

WHich regions have highest? Lowest?
What variables seem to impact rates?

What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

Data from Health Insurance Marketplace

What do you know about the data so far?

Its managable for first project. Several demographic columns, 5 differnt continuous variables of premiums. About 75000 lines of data.  I could try to merge with
region data or maybe state death rates.

Why did you choose this topic?

I had planned on using work data, but restrictions from the Army won't allow me so I am doing 
medical industry because our company just acquired a healthcare consultantcy company and I would 
like to shift into healthcare and get out of govt.
